    <string name="hand_clock_description">i applied in this sample basics of drawing in canvas using some math, it is redraw only once every second, and as you see, it is kinda accurate with a little milliseconds delay, this bug can be fixed to make the hour completely accurate but for now that\'s fine</string>

    <string name="tic_tac_toe_description">applying canvas animations to draw each item from the board, it doesn\'t recomposes at all, another thing is that is i set the touch event by listening to release instead of press, i think it must be on release, since this is a game, i don\'t think there is need to show results since the purpose is canvas itself</string>
